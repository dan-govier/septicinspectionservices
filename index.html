                    <p>Septic Inspection Services, LLC, in WI is owned and operated by Ty Prigge. We operate in and service Vilas & parts of Oneida County, WI.</p>
                    <p>Many people are under the impression that septic tanks need to be pumped every three years. This is not true! If the tank isn‚Äôt too full, then the waste will continue to break down over time and pumping is not necessary!</p>
                    <p>If we inspect your tank and it needs to be pumped, then you can save your money for the pump! We won‚Äôt charge you a dime.</p>

                    <p>There is no law that compels you to have the septic tank pumped out every three years, as many people are led to believe. The State Statute and Administrative Code states this may not exceed 1/3 the volume of the septic tank or 16‚Ä≥ in height. That is about 300+ gallons, leaving 700 gallons of ‚Äúgray water‚Äù in a 1,000 gallon tank. </p>
                    <p>The sludge in the tank consists of nothing more than human excrement and toilet tissue that settles to the bottom of a septic tank where it biodegrades by the action of microbes and dissolves into a liquid. There is always more liquid present in a septic tank than sludge, so why pay more for having almost 1,000 gallons of waste water pumped from a 1,000 gallon tank when it is not necessary?</p>
                    <p>If your dwelling is only occupied part of the year, you are living alone, if the residence is empty or for sale, or the house is empty most of the day, the tank will probably not have to be pumped for many years. How do you know when your tank is at 1/3 full of sludge and if it needs to be pumped? That is where my service comes into play.</p>
                    <aside>There must be an unobstructed access into the top of the septic tank through a visible 4‚Ä≥ inspection pipe or a visible 24‚Ä≥ manhole cover, both protruding above ground level. Without one or the other, an inspection cannot be conducted. If you have an older tank and there is not a 4‚Ä≥ inspection pipe and the manhole cover is buried ‚Äúbelow grade‚Äù, THIS MUST BE DUG UP so the manhole cover is visible from above and accessible prior to inspection.</aside>
                    <p>After you receive your notice from the county, <a href="files/Septic_Inpection_Form.pdf">print out this form</a> and mail it to our PO Box (PO Box 556 Boulder Jct, WI 54512), and we‚Äôll set up an appointment.  On the card that you will receive from the county, there is a choice of, ‚ÄúA‚Äù Inspected Only, or ‚ÄúB‚Äù Pumped Out. After an inspection is conducted, if the tank needs to be pumped, your check will be returned to you along with the county notice and then you may contact a pumper of your choice. If the tank doesn‚Äôt need to be pumped, I will mail or email you the results of your inspection and record the results with the county.</p>
