                    <p>Septic Inspection Services, LLC, in WI is owned and operated by Ty Prigge. We operate in and service Vilas & parts of Oneida County, WI.</p>
                    <p>Many people are under the impression that septic tanks need to be pumped every three years. This is not true! If the tank isn’t too full, then the waste will continue to break down over time and pumping is not necessary!</p>
                    <p>If we inspect your tank and it needs to be pumped, then you can save your money for the pump! We won’t charge you a dime.</p>

                    <p>Vilas County residents with septic tanks must have their tanks inspected every three years. After you receive your notice from the county, make an appointment with us and we’ll come and inspect your tank.</p>
                    <aside>There must be an unobstructed access into the top of the septic tank through a visible 4″ inspection pipe or a visible 24″ manhole cover, both protruding above ground level. Without one or the other, an inspection cannot be conducted. If you have an older tank and there is not a 4″ inspection pipe and the manhole cover is buried “below grade”, THIS MUST BE DUG UP so the manhole cover is visible from above and accessible prior to inspection.</aside>
                    <p>After an inspection is conducted, I will mail or email you the results of the inspection. Upon inspection the results will be recorded with Vilas County and it will be another three years before another inspection.</p>

                    <p>This is what Septic Inspection Service can do for you for $90.00, at about 1/3 the cost of the tank being unnecessarily pumped. There is no law that compels you to have the septic tank pumped out every three years, as many people are led to believe. If your dwelling is only occupied part of the year, you are living alone, if the residence is empty or for sale, or the house is empty most of the day, the tank will probably not have to be pumped for many years. On the card that you will receive from the county, there is a choice of, “A” Inspected Only, or “B” Pumped Out. (This only needs to be done if the septic tank has 16″ of sludge or 1/3 of the tank.) The sludge in the tank consists of nothing more than human excrement and toilet tissue that settles to the bottom of a septic tank where it biodegrades by the action of microbes and dissolves into a liquid. There is always more liquid present in a septic tank than sludge, so why pay more for having almost 1,000 gallons of waste water pumped from a 1,000 gallon tank when it is not necessary?</p>
